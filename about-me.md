<h2>Majid Iranpour | Senior Cyber Security Specialist</h2>

</div>

<p>
I have a strong focus on offensive security, secure architecture design, and protocol-level analysis. With hands-on experience in penetration testing, red teaming, and low-level network engineering, I specialize in identifying real-world attack paths and building resilient defensive strategies.
</p>

<p>
My technical expertise includes Windows and Linux internals, secure coding in C, Go, JavaScript, and Python, exploit development fundamentals, and advanced threat modeling.
</p>

<p>
I actively research modern attack techniques, write technical breakdowns, and develop custom security tools to better understand adversarial behavior at a deeper level.
